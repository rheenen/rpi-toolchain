   Raspberry Pi Toolchain used by Marshmallow Game Engine (@marshmallow_h)
==============================================================================

How to clone
------------

The fastest way to get a working checkout is to only clone the toolchain base
and then shallow clone the submodules, like so:

    $ git clone git://github.com/gamaral/rpi-toolchain.git
    $ cd rpi-toolchain
    $ scripts/quick-clone


Alternatively, if you have the time and bandwidth, you could just run the
following:

    $ git clone --recursive git://github.com/gamaral/rpi-toolchain.git

How to use
----------

Notice: The following script only works for 'bash'.

I provide a simple environment script that can be used to load both the
*hardfp* and *softfp* versions of the toolchain. While the script defaults to
hardfp, you may request softfp by passing 'soft' or 'softfp' as the first
parameter of the script.

    Examples: ./env softfp make
              source ./env softfp

As you noticed above, you have two ways of loading the environment, the first
is to source then environment script:

    $ source ./env

You can alternatively use the environment script to bootstrap another process,
like cmake:

    $ <path-to-toolchain>/env [soft] cmake ..

The script will populate the following environment variables used by
'marshmallow_h':

    RPITOOLCHAIN_TARGET
    RPITOOLCHAIN
    RPIFIRMWARE

Marshmallow Game Engine
-----------------------

Run the following commands while in your local *marshmallow_h* cloned
repository's build directory.

    $ source <path-to-toolchain>/env
    $ cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/Toolchain-raspberrypi.cmake \
            -C../cmake/Cache-raspberrypi.cmake ..
    $ make

Now cross your fingers.
